# Probability-Projects
This repository contains several hands-on projects completed under the PSDV course (Probability, Statistics, and Data Visualization) at IIT Gandhinagar. The projects explore a wide range of topics from probability distributions to real-world data analysis, implemented using Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and statistical methods.

📂** Project List**
1. PMF of Discrete Random Variables
🔗 Colab Notebook

Plotted PMFs for: Discrete Uniform, Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, and Geometric distributions.

Demonstrated parameter variations and compared the outcomes visually.

Showed the convergence of Binomial to Poisson for large n and small p.

2. PDF and CDF of Continuous Random Variables
🔗 Colab Notebook

Plotted PDFs and CDFs for: Uniform, Gaussian, Exponential, Cauchy, Laplacian, and Rayleigh distributions.

Compared variations by changing parameters.

Also plotted CDFs of previously studied discrete distributions.

3. Otsu’s Thresholding on Noisy Images
🔗 Colab Notebook

Implemented Otsu’s method for binarizing grayscale images.

Added Gaussian noise with varying variances and studied its effect on thresholding.

Used image datasets for visual demonstrations.

4. Joint PMF, Marginals, and Expectation
🔗 Colab Notebook

Verified independence between two random variables based on Joint PMF.

Computed and visualized Joint and Marginal PMFs/CDFs.

Calculated expectations: E[XY] and E[(X−E[X])(Y−E[Y])].

5. Descriptive Statistics on the IRIS Dataset
🔗 Colab Notebook

Estimated means and variances of features in the Iris dataset.

Computed pairwise correlation coefficients.

Repeated analysis per species to highlight intra-species variation.

6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the IRIS Dataset
🔗 Colab Notebook

Computed covariance matrix and PCA components.

Reduced dimensions from 4D to 2D and 3D.

Visualized clusters using color-coded scatter plots per species.

7. ATP Match Data Statistical Analysis
🔗 Colab Notebook

Analyzed professional tennis data from ATP matches and players.

Asked and answered 10+ insightful statistical questions using visualization and summary statistics.

Applied concepts like mean, variance, correlation, and grouping in practice.
