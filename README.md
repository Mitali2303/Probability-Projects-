# Probability-Projects
This repository contains several hands-on projects completed under the PSDV course (Probability, Statistics, and Data Visualization) at IIT Gandhinagar. The projects explore a wide range of topics from probability distributions to real-world data analysis, implemented using Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and statistical methods.

📂**Project List**  

**1. PMF of Discrete Random Variables**  
🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_9ZhbXfZMht4br1305vc7r64l0zGGBMV?usp=sharing)  

Plotted PMFs for: Discrete Uniform, Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, and Geometric distributions.

Demonstrated parameter variations and compared the outcomes visually.

Showed the convergence of Binomial to Poisson for large n and small p.


**2. PDF and CDF of Continuous Random Variables**  
🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11FZGlG-aC0dTO52yc35LkbHEAcdBfTQM?usp=sharing)  

Plotted PDFs and CDFs for: Uniform, Gaussian, Exponential, Cauchy, Laplacian, and Rayleigh distributions.

Compared variations by changing parameters.

Also plotted CDFs of previously studied discrete distributions.


**3. Otsu’s Thresholding on Noisy Images**  
🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A-nLEqG4AGktBzPc62EKFPVdW9qcOlFY?usp=sharing) 

Implemented Otsu’s method for binarizing grayscale images.

Added Gaussian noise with varying variances and studied its effect on thresholding.

Used image datasets for visual demonstrations.


**4. Joint PMF, Marginals, and Expectation**  
🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/110T47LI74eau8iDwV-cC0u1RU34-S-0u?usp=sharing)  

Verified independence between two random variables based on Joint PMF.

Computed and visualized Joint and Marginal PMFs/CDFs.

Calculated expectations: E[XY] and E[(X−E[X])(Y−E[Y])].


**5. Descriptive Statistics on the IRIS Dataset**  
🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iqP7ccyYn4XQJEE0_zuO1gq8iR7Sd5hC?usp=sharing)  

Estimated means and variances of features in the Iris dataset.

Computed pairwise correlation coefficients.

Repeated analysis per species to highlight intra-species variation.


**6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the IRIS Dataset**  
🔗 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vXgh79KGFEazOO4334BQY9OnAcqwOGIl?usp=sharing)
